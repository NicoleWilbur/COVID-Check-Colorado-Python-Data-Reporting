# COVID Check Colorado Python Data Reporting Project

I created this project to automate some data collection and reporting I was doing manually during my time at COVID Check Colorado.
We were tracking our outreach efforts and the resultant number of appointments made to guide future outreach efforts.

## Overview

After I created the tables in the SQL Server database and the stored procedures for updating them, I created some pivot charts and graphs
of the data to present to the cross-functional team in Excel. I offered the data and visualizations on a daily basis, and they agreed it would be helpful. 
Therefore, I created this Python program to run the stored procedures in SQL Server to update the tables daily, update and format some text files daily,
create charts and graphs based off that data, and e-mail it to involved parties.
